#The rooms should show up as a list with the address, city, state,
 #and price on the list and when the user clicks on the link for an item, it goes to another screen and shows the detail of the 
 #individual listing: description, rules, wifi (yes/no), cable (none/basic/premium) and private bathroom (yes/no).

#Finally, every listing should have an isRented field that is used to show that 
#the listing is already taken or not. Rooms that have been rented out arent' deleted, they are marked as isRented. When Dave logs in, he can add a
 #listing or change a listing to be rented or not. He does not delete listings. Only dave should be able to add or update a listing.
